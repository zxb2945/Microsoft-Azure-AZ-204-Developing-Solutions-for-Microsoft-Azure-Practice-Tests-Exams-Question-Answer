| 193   | [You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to `ContentUploadService`. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Microsoft Entra ID: Contoso, Ltd. uses Microsoft Entra ID for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Microsoft Entra ID. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version. Issues: Users of the `ContentUploadService` report that they occasionally see HTTP `502` responses on specific pages. Code - `ContentUploadService` - `ApplicationManifest`.

| 212   | [You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to `ContentUploadService`. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Microsoft Entra ID: Contoso, Ltd. uses Microsoft Entra ID for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Microsoft Entra ID. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version. Issues: Users of the `ContentUploadService` report that they occasionally see HTTP `502` responses on specific pages. Code - `ContentUploadService` - `ApplicationManifest`.

| 215   | [You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to `ContentUploadService`. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Microsoft Entra ID: Contoso, Ltd. uses Microsoft Entra ID for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Microsoft Entra ID. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version. Issues: Users of the `ContentUploadService` report that they occasionally see HTTP `502` responses on specific pages. Code - `ContentUploadService` - `ApplicationManifest`.

| 219   | [You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to `ContentUploadService`. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Microsoft Entra ID: Contoso, Ltd. uses Microsoft Entra ID for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Microsoft Entra ID. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version.

### You are developing an Azure solution to collect point-of-sale (POS) device data from 2,000 stores located throughout the world. A single device can produce 2 megabytes (MB) of data every 24 hours. Each store location has one to five devices that send data. You must store the device data in Azure Blob storage. Device data must be correlated based on a device identifier. Additional stores are expected to open in the future. You need to implement a solution to receive the device data. Solution: Provision an Azure Service Bus. Configure a topic to receive the device data by using a correlation filter. Does the solution meet the goal?

- [x] Yes.
- [ ] No.

>   - 支持重复检测、事务、死信队列（DLQ）
>   - 类似 Azure Storage Queue，但更强大（例如支持复杂消息类型、事务、消息会话）
>
> ------
>
> ### ✅ **2. Azure Service Bus Topic + Subscription**
>
> - **模型**：发布-订阅（Publish-Subscribe）
>
> - **发送者**：向 Topic 发布消息
>
> - **接收者**：多个 Subscription 可以各自独立接收同一条消息副本
>
> - **特点**：
>
>   - 每个 Subscription 都像一个独立的队列
>
>   - 支持 **过滤器**（Filter）和 **动作（Action）**，可以根据消息属性将消息分发给不同订阅
>
>   - 一条消息可以送达多个订阅者，无需轮询（可绑定 Azure Function 等自动触发处理）

### A company is implementing a publish-subscribe (Pub/Sub) messaging component by using Azure Service Bus. You are developing the first subscription application. In the Azure portal you see that messages are being sent to the subscription for each topic. You create and initialize a subscription client object by supplying the correct details, but the subscription application is still not consuming the messages. You need to ensure that the subscription client processes all messages. Which code segment should you use?

- [ ] `await subscriptionClient.AddRuleAsync(new RuleDescription(RuleDescription.DefaultRuleName, new TrueFilter()));`.
- [ ] `subscriptionClient = new SubscriptionClient(ServiceBusConnectionString, TopicName, SubscriptionName);`.
- [ ] `await subscriptionClient.CloseAsync();`.
- [x] `subscriptionClient.RegisterMessageHandler(ProcessMessagesAsync, messageHandlerOptions);`.

> ### 注意：
>
> 你提到“subscription client 仍然没有消费消息”，这可能是因为**缺少 StartProcessingAsync** 或 **没有注册 message handler**。
>
> ------
>
> ### 如果你用的是旧的 `Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus` SDK，则应使用：
>
> ```C#
> SubscriptionClient client = new SubscriptionClient(connectionString, topicName, subscriptionName);
> 
> client.RegisterMessageHandler(
>     async (message, token) =>
>     {
>         string body = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(message.Body);
>         Console.WriteLine($"Received: {body}");
> 
>         await client.CompleteAsync(message.SystemProperties.LockToken);
>     },
>     new MessageHandlerOptions(args =>
>     {
>         Console.WriteLine(args.Exception);
>         return Task.CompletedTask;
>     })
> );
> ```
>
> ### 结论：
>
> 你需要添加或修正的是这一句核心代码：
>
> > ✅ `RegisterMessageHandler(...)`（旧 SDK）
> >  ✅ `processor.ProcessMessageAsync += ...` 并调用 `StartProcessingAsync()`（新 SDK）
>

### You are developing an Azure solution to collect point-of-sale (POS) device data from 2,000 stores located throughout the world. A single device can produce 2 megabytes (MB) of data every 24 hours. Each store location has one to five devices that send data. You must store the device data in Azure Blob storage. Device data must be correlated based on a device identifier. Additional stores are expected to open in the future. You need to implement a solution to receive the device data. Solution: Provision an Azure Event Hub. Configure the machine identifier as the partition key and enable capture. Does the solution meet the goal?

- [x] Yes.

### A company is developing a solution that allows smart refrigerators to send temperature information to a central location. The solution must receive and store messages until they can be processed. You create an Azure Service Bus instance by providing a name, pricing tier, subscription, resource group, and location. You need to complete the configuration. Which Azure CLI or PowerShell command should you run?

- [ ] `az group create --name fridge-rg --location fridge-loc`.
- [ ] `New-AzureRmServiceBusNamespace -ResourceGroupName fridge-rg -NamespaceName fridge-ns -Location fridge-loc`.

> ### 选项分析：
>
> 1. `az group create --name fridge-rg --location fridge-loc`
>    - 这是创建 **资源组** 的命令，不是配置 Service Bus。
>    - **不正确**，这是基础资源组创建。
> 2. `New-AzureRmServiceBusNamespace -ResourceGroupName fridge-rg -NamespaceName fridge-ns -Location fridge-loc`
>    - 这是 PowerShell 命令，用于**创建 Service Bus 命名空间（Namespace）**。
>    - 这步是必需的，但题目说“已经创建了 Service Bus 实例”，所以可能已经完成。
>    - **不完全符合题目要求**（完成配置），但如果没有命名空间的话必须执行。
> 3. `New-AzureRmServiceBusQueue -ResourceGroupName fridge-rg -NamespaceName fridge-ns -Name fridge-q -EnablePartitioning $False`
>    - 这是 PowerShell 命令，用于**创建 Service Bus 队列**。
>    - 这一步才是“完成配置”的关键：创建用于接收消息的队列。
>    - **正确答案**。
> 4. `az servicebus namespace create --resource-group fridge-rg --name fridge-rg --location fridge-loc`
>    - 这是用 Azure CLI 创建 Service Bus 命名空间的命令。
>    - 注意这里 `--name fridge-rg`，和资源组名相同，实际应是命名空间名称，不一定是资源组名。
>    - 同样这是创建命名空间，跟题意“完成配置”中创建队列相比，不是最终目标。

### You are developing an application that processes Azure Blob storage events.

> 这个解决方案并**不**能完全满足所有要求。
>
> 以下是详细分析：
>
> - **处理异步事件和元数据更改：** Azure Event Grid 非常适合这个需求。当 Azure Blob 存储中发生更改时，Event Grid 会立即发布事件，你的 Azure Function 应用作为订阅者可以异步地处理这些事件。这部分要求是满足的。
> - **按事件发生的顺序处理更改：** Event Grid **不保证**事件的顺序。虽然它通常会按照顺序发送事件，但在高负载或系统故障的情况下，事件可能会无序到达。因此，仅仅依赖 Event Grid 无法保证按顺序处理。
> - **保留更改以用于合规性：** Event Grid 的核心功能是传递事件，而不是持久化事件以供长期保留。Event Grid 事件在被传递给订阅者后，其生命周期就结束了。如果订阅者无法及时处理事件，Event Grid 会进行重试，但如果重试失败，事件可能会丢失。为了合规性，你需要一个单独的机制来持久化这些事件或处理结果，例如将事件写入一个持久性存储（如 Azure Blob 存储、Azure Cosmos DB）或者使用具有消息持久化能力的服务（如 Azure Service Bus 或 Azure Event Hubs）。仅仅使用 Event Grid 和 Azure Function 无法满足长期保留的要求。
>

### You are developing an e-Commerce Web App. You want to use Azure Key Vault to ensure that sign-ins to the e-Commerce Web App are secured by using Azure App Service authentication and Microsoft Entra ID. What should you do on the e-Commerce Web App?

- [ ] Run the `az keyvault secret` command.
- [ ] Enable Microsoft Entra ID Connect.
- [x] Enable Managed Service Identity (MSI).
- [ ] Create an Microsoft Entra ID service principal.

> ### 关键点：
>
> - Azure App Service Authentication（也叫 Easy Auth）本身支持集成 Microsoft Entra ID 进行用户认证。
> - 使用 **Azure Key Vault** 的主要目的是安全地管理和存储敏感信息（如客户端机密 `client secret`），避免在应用配置中直接暴露。
> - 你需要将 Key Vault 中存储的机密（比如 Azure AD 应用的客户端机密）与 App Service 的认证配置集成起来。
>
> ------
>
> ### 应该做的步骤：
>
> 1. **在 Azure Key Vault 中存储 Microsoft Entra ID 应用的机密**（Client Secret）。
> 2. **为 Azure App Service 启用托管身份（Managed Identity）**，允许它访问 Key Vault。
> 3. **在 Azure Key Vault 访问策略中授权该托管身份，允许读取机密**。
> 4. **配置 e-Commerce Web App 的身份验证设置**，使其使用托管身份从 Key Vault 获取客户端机密，或通过配置将机密引用为应用设置中的 Key Vault 机密引用。
> 5. **在 Azure App Service 的应用设置中，通过 Key Vault 引用配置敏感信息**
> 6. **启用并配置 Azure App Service Authentication，选择 Microsoft Entra ID 作为身份提供者。**
>
> 如果只回答针对“**在 e-Commerce Web App 上你应该做什么**”，最核心的动作是：

>      - **分配对象**：要启用 MFA 的用户或组（例如 Web 应用使用者）。
>      - **云应用或操作**：选择你的 Web 应用（或 All cloud apps）。
>      - **授予控制**：选择 **Require multifactor authentication**。
> 2. **确保用户已注册 MFA**：
>    - 用户需要在第一次登录时完成 MFA 注册（手机验证、认证器 App、FIDO2 密钥等方式）。
> 3. （可选）**确保 Web 应用启用了 Microsoft Entra ID 认证**：
>    - 在 Azure Portal 中进入 Web App。
>    - 选择 **Authentication** > 启用身份验证。
>    - 添加身份提供者，选择 **Microsoft Entra ID**，配置客户端 ID 和重定向 URI。

- [ ] Yes.
- [x] No.

> 你需要为 Azure API Management (APIM) 配置后端身份验证，以确保 APIM 调用你 Azure App Service 中托管的 API 时，能够通过身份验证。
>
> ### 解析：
>
> - **Basic Gateway Credentials** 指的是在 Azure API Management (APIM) 中为后端服务配置的基本身份验证（用户名和密码）。
> - 如果你的 Azure App Service 托管的 API 后端要求使用 Basic Authentication，这种配置能确保 APIM 调用时携带正确的认证信息，从而完成身份验证。
>
> 
>
> ------
>
> ## 常见方案及步骤：
>
> ### 1. **选择认证类型**
>
> 后端认证常见类型有：
>
> - **基本认证（Basic Authentication）**：用户名+密码    =>**Basic Gateway Credentials** 是 APIM 配置后端 Basic Authentication 的一种具体实现。
> - **客户端证书认证（Client Certificate）**：APIM 用证书与后端建立 TLS 连接
> - **OAuth 2.0 / JWT 令牌认证**：APIM 作为客户端获取访问令牌，调用后端
>
> ------
>
> ### 2. **配置 APIM 后端身份验证**
>
> #### 示例：设置基本认证
>
> 在 APIM 中：
>
> - 进入 API Management 实例 > APIs > 选择对应 API > Settings
> - 找到 **“Backend”** 部分的 **Authentication Settings**
> - 启用 Basic Authentication，填写用户名和密码
>
> ------
>
> #### 示例：使用客户端证书
>
> - 在 APIM 的“安全性”部分上传客户端证书
> - 绑定客户端证书到后端 API 调用配置
> - 后端 API 要配置为接受该客户端证书
>
> ------
>
> ### 3. **在 API 中配置策略（Policy）**
>
> 可在 APIM API 的 Inbound 或 Backend 节点配置策略，比如添加 Authorization header：
>
> ```

### You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to `ContentUploadService`. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Microsoft Entra ID: Contoso, Ltd. uses Microsoft Entra ID for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Microsoft Entra ID. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version. Issues: Users of the `ContentUploadService` report that they occasionally see HTTP `502` responses on specific pages. Code - `ContentUploadService` - `ApplicationManifest`. You need to add code at line AM09 to ensure that users can review content using ContentAnalysisService. How should you complete the code?

### You are building a website to access project data related to teams within your organization. The website does not allow anonymous access. Authentication is performed using an Microsoft Entra ID app named internal. The website has the following authentication requirements: Microsoft Entra ID users must be able to login to the website. Personalization of the website must be based on membership in Active Directory groups. You need to configure the application's manifest to meet the authentication requirements. How should you configure the manifest?

> ### ✅【解决方案目标】
>
> 通过配置应用的 Manifest（应用程序清单），确保：
>
> - 应用在用户登录后可以**获取用户的组成员信息**；
> - 正确设置必要的权限字段
>
> 你需要修改 Entra 应用的 manifest（清单），重点是下面两个属性：
>
> #### 1. `"groupMembershipClaims"` 属性
>
> 这是 **关键字段**，用于告诉 Entra ID 在发出的 ID 令牌或访问令牌中，是否应包含用户所属的组。
>
> **解释**：设置为 `"SecurityGroup"` 表示包含用户所属于的所有 **安全组** 的 Object ID。
>
> 其他选项：
>
> - `"All"`：包含安全组和Office 365组
> - `null` 或省略：不返回组信息（默认）
>
> #### 2. （可选）设置 `requiredResourceAccess` 权限
>
> 虽然主问题重点在 manifest，但为了能让网站读取用户组信息，还需要：
>
> - 向 Entra 应用授予 Microsoft Graph 的相关权限，如：
>
> ```json
> "requiredResourceAccess": [
>   {
>     "resourceAppId": "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000", // Microsoft Graph 的 appId
>     "resourceAccess": [
>       {
>         "id": "e1fe6dd8-ba31-4d61-89e7-88639da4683d", // User.Read
>         "type": "Scope"
>       },
>       {
>         "id": "5b567255-7703-4780-807c-7be8301ae99b", // GroupMember.Read.All
>         "type": "Role"
>       }
>     ]
>   }
> ]
> ```
>
> 但第二个 Dropdown 后面是 `true`，而 `"requiredResourceAccess"` 无法赋值为 `true`
>
> ###  分析两个可选字段的含义：
>
> 1. `"allowPublicClient": true`
>    - 含义：允许此应用作为**公共客户端**使用（例如：原生客户端、移动应用等）。
>    - 用于场景：桌面或移动 app，通过授权码流交互 Entra ID。
> 2. `"oauth2AllowImplicitFlow": true`
>    - 含义：允许使用 OAuth2 隐式授权流（现在已不推荐，但有些老的 SPA 使用它）。
>    - 用于场景：单页应用（SPA）直接从 URL 中获取令牌，不通过后端。
>
> 题干回顾：网站为组织内访问，不允许匿名访问；
>
> ### ✅ 最终答案：
>
> | 填空项     | 答案                      |
> | ---------- | ------------------------- |
> | Dropdown 1 | `groupMembershipClaims`   |

### You are developing a web application that makes calls to the Microsoft Graph API. You register the application in the Azure portal and upload a valid `X509` certificate. You create an appsettings.json file containing the certificate name, client identifier for the application, and the tenant identifier of the Microsoft Entra ID. You create a method named `ReadCertificate` to return the `X509` certificate by name. You need to implement code that acquires a token by using the certificate. How should you complete the code segment?

> // 定义作用域
> string[] scopes = new[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };
> // 获取访问令牌
> var result = await clientApp.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes).ExecuteAsync();
> ```
>
> 因为访问令牌是有“权限范围”的，定义 scope 就是告诉授权服务器：我这个令牌要用来访问哪个资源、要干什么事。
>
> ## 🧠 类比理解：
>
> 想象你去政府办事，需要办“驾照”或“护照”：
>
> - 你提交申请（相当于：AcquireToken）

### You have an Azure Web app that uses Cosmos DB as a data store. You create a CosmosDB container by running the following PowerShell script: `$resourceGroupName = 'testResourceGroup' $accountName = 'testCosmosAccount' $databaseName = 'testDatabase' $containerName = 'testContainer' $partitionKeyPath = '/EmployeeId' $autoscaleMaxThroughput = 5000 New-AzCosmosDBSqlContainer - -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -AccountName $accountName -DatabaseName $databaseName -Name $containerName -PartitionKeyKind Hash -PartitionKeyPath $partitionKeyPath -AutoscaleMaxThroughput $autoscaleMaxThroughput`. You create the following queries that target the container: `SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.EmployeeId > '12345' SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.UserID = '12345'`. Question 1: The minimum throughput for the container is 400 R/Us.

- [ ] Yes.
- [x] No.

> ### 🔹**容器创建脚本回顾**
>
> ```shell
> $resourceGroupName = 'testResourceGroup'
> $accountName = 'testCosmosAccount'

>
> - 使用了 **Autoscale**，最大吞吐量为 `5000 RU/s`。
> - 使用了 **分区键为 `/EmployeeId`**。
> - 创建的是 **SQL API 的容器（Cosmos DB）**。
>
> ### 🔹**Autoscale 相关重点**
>
> 启用 autoscale 时，Cosmos DB 会根据负载自动调整吞吐量，**其最小吞吐量为 `max throughput` 的 10%**。
>
> > 🚩 所以：
> >  **5000 RU/s × 10% = 500 RU/s**
>

You create the following queries that target the container: `SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.EmployeeId > '12345' SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.UserID = '12345'`. Question 2: The first query statement is an in-partition query.

- [ ] Yes.
- [x] No.

> ## ✅ 定义：什么是 In-Partition Query？
>
> **In-partition query（单分区查询）** 的意思是：查询只会命中某一个具体分区，而不会跨多个分区读取数据。
>
> 要做到这一点，必须满足以下条件之一：
>
> 1. 查询的 **过滤条件中包含具体的分区键值**，例如：
>
>    ```sql
>    SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.EmployeeId = '12345'
>    ```
>
>    → 明确告诉 Cosmos DB 要查哪个分区。
>
> 2. 使用 SDK 查询时，**在代码中提供 partition key 的值**。
>
> ## ❌ 为什么题目中的查询 *不是* In-Partition Query？
>
> 你的查询是：
>
> ```
> sql
> 
> 
> CopyEdit
> SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.EmployeeId > '12345'
> ```
>
> ### 分析：
>
> - ✅ 使用了分区键字段（`EmployeeId`），这是一个好的开始。
> - ❌ 但是是 **范围查询**，并没有指定一个具体的 `EmployeeId` 值。
>
> > Cosmos DB 不知道你想查哪一个分区，因为它无法根据 `> '12345'` 判断唯一分区 —— 所以必须 **检查所有分区** 才能返回结果。
>
> 这就会触发所谓的 **跨分区查询（cross-partition query）**。

Question 3: The second query statement is a cross-partition query.

- [x] Yes.
- [ ] No.

> ## 🔍 Cosmos DB 查询是否为跨分区（cross-partition）的判断逻辑
>
> 如果查询中 **没有使用容器的分区键字段 `EmployeeId`**，那 Cosmos DB 就无法通过查询直接确定要访问哪一个分区，**必须扫描所有分区** —— 也就是说：

> ------
>
> ## ✅ 分析当前这个查询
>
> 查询：
>
> ```sql

> ```
>
> - 它使用了 `UserID`，但你的容器是按 `/EmployeeId` 分区的。

### Your Microsoft Entra ID tenant has an Azure subscription linked to it. Your developer has created a mobile application that obtains Microsoft Entra ID access tokens using the OAuth 2 implicit grant type. The mobile application must be registered in Microsoft Entra ID. You require [a redirect URI] from the developer for registration purposes.

- [x] No change required.
- [ ] a secret.
- [ ] a login hint.
- [ ] a client ID.

> ## 🔄 背景：OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant Type 是什么？
>
> 这是 OAuth 的一种授权模式，**专门为客户端（如SPA、移动应用）设计**，这些客户端 **无法安全存储机密（client secret）**。
>
> - 这种模式下，客户端**直接从浏览器地址栏**中获得 `access_token`。
> - 适合浏览器运行或运行在不安全环境中的应用程序（如 JS 单页应用、移动 App）。
> - 现在推荐用 Authorization Code + PKCE 代替，但一些老项目仍然使用 implicit flow。

### You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to `ContentUploadService`. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Microsoft Entra ID: Contoso, Ltd. uses Microsoft Entra ID for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Microsoft Entra ID. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version. Issues: Users of the `ContentUploadService` report that they occasionally see HTTP `502` responses on specific pages. Code - `ContentUploadService` - `ApplicationManifest`. You need to store the user agreements. Where should you store the agreement after it is completed?

All service calls must be authenticated by using Microsoft Entra ID. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version. Issues: Users of the `ContentUploadService` report that they occasionally see HTTP `502` responses on specific pages. Code - `ContentUploadService` - `ApplicationManifest`. You need to investigate the http server log output to resolve the issue with the `ContentUploadService`. Which command should you use first?

### You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to `ContentUploadService`. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Microsoft Entra ID: Contoso, Ltd. uses Microsoft Entra ID for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Microsoft Entra ID. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour.

>     "value": "ContentReviewer"
>   }
> ]
> ```
>
> ### 中文解释：
>
> 这是在 Azure AD 应用注册的 **manifest** 中添加 **应用角色 (App Roles)** 的格式：
>
> | 字段                 | 说明                                                         |
> | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
> | `allowedMemberTypes` | 表示哪些类型的主体可以分配此角色，常见值是 `"User"`。        |
> | `description`        | 角色的描述，用于 Azure 门户中的提示信息。                    |
> | `displayName`        | 角色的显示名称。                                             |
> | `id`                 | 每个角色必须有唯一的 GUID。你可以用工具（如 `uuidgen`）生成一个。 |
> | `isEnabled`          | 是否启用此角色。必须为 `true`。                              |
> | `value`              | 角色的程序使用值（用于 `roles` claim 中）。                  |
>
> 
>
> ### 使用建议：
>
> 1. **添加后保存 manifest** 并重新加载应用注册页面。
> 2. 在 Enterprise Applications 里将用户分配到 `ContentReviewer` 角色。
> 3. 用户登录时，会从 token 中获取 `roles` claim，其中会包含 `ContentReviewer`。
>
> 
>
> 这个 **`ApplicationManifest`（应用清单 / manifest）** 是 Azure 中**应用注册（App registration）**的一部分，主要存在于 Microsoft Entra ID（原 Azure AD）中，用于描述和配置你的应用的身份验证和授权行为。
>
> ### ✅ **它存在在哪里？**
>
> 它存在于：
>  **Azure Portal > Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations > 你的应用 > Manifest**
>
> 或通过 Azure CLI / Microsoft Graph API 访问。
>
> ### 🧾 **这个 Manifest 是给谁用的？**
>
> | 使用者             | 说明                                                         |
> | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
> | **Azure 系统本身** | 解析此 manifest 来配置应用的权限、角色、安全性行为等。       |
> | **管理员/开发者**  | 你（开发者/管理员）通过编辑这个 JSON 文件定义应用角色（如 `ContentReviewer`）、API 权限、重定向 URI 等。 |
> | **前端/后端应用**  | 当用户登录后，其 JWT token 中会包含你定义的角色（如 `roles: ["ContentReviewer"]`），供你的应用做授权检查。 |

>
> ### 🔍 逐项解释下拉选项选择：
>
> #### ✅ 第一空：`event.eventType === "ImageDeployed"`
>
> - 表示容器镜像已被部署。
> - 这是触发验证的时机：当新的镜像部署到 ContentAnalysisService 时。
>
> > 其他选项说明：
> >
> > - `ImagePushed`：指镜像被推送到 ACR，不一定被部署；
> > - `RepositoryUpdated`：表示有仓库变化，但可能非部署事件；
> > - 所以只有 `ImageDeployed` 是正确触发验证的事件类型。
>
> ------
>
> #### ✅ 第二空：`event.data.target.service === "contentanalysisservice"`
>
> - 指定部署目标的服务名称。
> - `ContentAnalysisService` 是系统中负责内容分析的服务，题干已经说明它部署在 Azure Container Instances 上。
>
> > 其他选项如 `image`, `repository`, `aci` 都不是指目标服务，语义不符。
>
> ------
>
> #### ✅ 第三空：`event.data.repository.contains("contosoimages")`
>
> - 仓库名中包含 `contosoimages`，说明使用的是 Contoso 的私有 ACR。
> - 用于判断部署镜像来源是否为预期仓库。

> ------
>
> ### ✅ 选项 1（你最初选择的）：
>
> > **Box 1: `ImagePushed`**, Box 2: `repository`, Box 3: `topic`
>
> - ❌ `ImagePushed`: **仅表示推送到 ACR**，还没部署。
> - ✅ `repository`: 是仓库字段（合理）。
> - ❌ `topic`: 事件源标识，不用于判断部署逻辑。
>
> ✅ 结论：**不符合“已部署”要求 → 错**
>
> ------
>
> ### ❌ 选项 2：
>
> > **Box 1: `ImageDeployed`**, Box 2: `service`, Box 3: `imageCollection`
>
> - ✅ `ImageDeployed`: ✅ 是部署完成后的事件！
> - ✅ `service`: ✅ 是部署目标（`ContentAnalysisService`）。
> - ❌ `imageCollection`: ❌ 没有这个字段（错误字段名）。
>
> ✅ 结论：**接近正确，但因 Box 3 错误字段 → 错**
>
> ------
>
> ### ❌ 选项 3：
>
> > **Box 1: `RepositoryUpdated`**, Box 2: `service`, Box 3: `imageCollection`
>
> - ❌ `RepositoryUpdated`: 没有这种有效事件类型
> - ✅ `service`: 合理

### You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to `ContentUploadService`. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Microsoft Entra ID: Contoso, Ltd. uses Microsoft Entra ID for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Microsoft Entra ID credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Microsoft Entra ID. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version. Issues: Users of the `ContentUploadService` report that they occasionally see HTTP `502` responses on specific pages. Code - `ContentUploadService` - `ApplicationManifest`. You need to configure the `ContentUploadService` deployment. Which two actions should you perform?

> | ❌ `type: Public`    | **错误**，因为题干要求服务应为**内部服务**，只能通过内部虚拟网络访问。Public 会暴露给互联网，不安全。 |
> | ✅ `type: Private`   | **正确**，符合“只能从内部虚拟网络访问”的要求。               |
> | ❌ `osType: Windows` | **错误**，题干没有任何地方提到使用 Windows 容器，反而因为使用了 Azure Container Instances（通常为 Linux 镜像），应该是 Linux。 |
> | ✅ `osType: Linux`   | **正确**，考虑到 `ContentAnalysisService` 是数据科学团队构建的分析服务，且部署于 Azure Container Instances 上，**通常使用 Linux 容器镜像**，成本也更低。 |
